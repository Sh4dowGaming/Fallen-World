       <h1>When it began, there was nothing.<br><br>
          
          Then the Big Bang sends seven magical auras hurtling across the galaxy, until<br>
          eventually coming to rest on various planets.<br><br>
          
          Death<br>
          The end of life, and the beggining of a new cycle.<br><br>
          
          Eternity<br>
          Forever, an endless cycle.<br><br>
          
          Power <br>
          What everyone wants, yet also everyone lacks.<br><br>          
         
          Perception <br>
          The illusion of what reality is.<br><br>          
          
          Matter <br>
          The universe is made of this.<br><br>
          
          Destruction <br>
          The true opposite of creation, and a powerful force.<br><br>
          
          Creation <br>
          The true opposite of destruction, and the birth of all entities.<br><br><br>
          
          
          These seven auras, with their magical attributes, were embedded in seperate planets. Many trillions of years later,<br>
          these seven planets' civilisations had the technology and the motive to harness the power of the aura that <br>
          they were blessed (or cursed) with. They found that the only metal capable of withstanding the awesome power <br>
          of the auras was Archaianium, an almost indestructible metal found on asteroids. The technology to mine it was <br>
          amazing. When the metal was presented to the auras, they accepted it and shaped it how they chose.<br><br>
          
          The scythe of Power <br>
          The warhammer of Death          <br>
          The axe of Eternity <br>        
          The sword of Creation <br>
          The trident of Matter <br>
          The spear of Perception <br>
          And, finally <br>
          The mace of Destruction. <br><br><br>
          
          
          The civilisations kept these weapons safe for many millions of years, until they discovered each other, <br>
          googolplexians of light years away from eachother. Wars broke out. Planets were destroyed. All of <br>
          the aura weapons were hidden. <br><br>
          
          However, in all the fighting, they overlooked what might happen if one of the weapons got to a planet that <br>
          was unfit or so technologically inferior to weild it. <br><br><br>
          
          
          And that did happen. When the Warhammer of Death was taken, the freighter ship it was on was attackd by space <br>
          pirates and the Warhammer was accidentally flung towards planet 18308732BQ, informally known <br>
          as 'earth'.<br><br>
          
          The Warhammer had to stop itself from being used to destroy, so it deactivated and instantly changed to appear <br>
          rusted.<br><br><br>
          
          
          On another planet, the only one that still had the weapon it created, a being, an entity, was angry.<br>
          It's name was the Overseer, and it wanted power. It wanted all seven of the auras.<br>
          Nobody could ever weild more than one weapon at a time without simply crumbling to dust as their <br>
          minds shattered, and even those who had held just one often went insane later. But the <br>
          Overseer was powerful, and he knew his place. He set out to planet 728389PZ, known informally <br>
          as 'Xanto'. They had held three of the seven auras, and had the aura of creation. The Overseer <br>
          threatened to crush their civilisation unless they built him a weapon capable of harnessing <br>
          the seven auras. They did what he said, and he killed them anyway. He took the Sword of Creation, and <br>
          he was instantly the most powerful being in existence. <br><br><br>
          
          
          Xanto was gone.
